# THIS IS BASED ON https://github.com/robertoEpe/love-haxe-wrappergen.
its just slightly edited to work on my machine, plus its now setup to straight out the box work by doing `love ./`.
(NOTE IF YOU DO THIS USING LOVE2D; there'll be a shit ton of command prompts that'll show up. dont be afraid.)
(its just for all the mkdir commands that need to run! i highly recommend installing a regular lua install though as its much quicker with that anyways.)


# THE ORIGNAL PROJECTS README!
This project uses the awesome [love-api][] project, which provides a lua tables representation of the love documention, to generate Haxe wrappers.
To use this project, make sure to checkout the submodule (`git submodule update --init love-api`).
